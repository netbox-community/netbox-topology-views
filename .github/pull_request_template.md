    IMPORTANT:
    ==========
    Thank you for contributing to NetBox Topology Views! Please 
    note that our contribution guidelines require a feature 
    request or bug report to be labeled "status: accepted". This 
    helps avoid waste time and effort on a proposed change that 
    we might not be able to accept.

    Please prefix the title of your pull request according to 
    it's type. You should use "Closes #FEATURE_ID: ..." for feature 
    requests and "Fixes #ISSUE_ID: ..." for issues. This helps 
    us closing issues automatically after merging.

    To sum it up:
    1. Create Bug Report or Feature Request
    2. Wait until the issue has been labeled "status: accepted"
    3. Start working on the issue in a seperate branch
    3. Create a pull request and name the title with a prefix 
       according to the issue ID.
